The movies dataset is obtained through Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB for a random sample of movies. The data set is comprised of 651 randomly sampled movies produced and released before 2016. I am interested in learning what attributes make a movie popular. The project consists of:

1. Data: Describes how the observations in the sample are collected, and the implications of data collection method on the scope of inference (generalizability / causality).

2. Research question: Came up with a research question that I wanted to answer.

3. EDA: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) that addresses the research question outlined above. 

4. Modeling: Developed a multiple linear regression model to predict the rating of a movie in the dataset.

5. Prediction: Picked a movie from 2016 (a new movie that is not in the sample) and did a prediction for this movie using the model developed. Also quantified the uncertainty around this prediction using an appropriate interval.

6. Conclusion: Includeed a brief summary of my findings from the previous sections. Also discussed any shortcomings of the current study (either due to data collection or methodology) and included ideas for possible future research.
